The  Store may be configured to request the email address used in the purchasing to check the validity of download link.

		&lt;title&gt;Title of the first product&lt;/title&gt;

		&lt;image width=&quot;number&quot; height=&quot;number&quot; price=&quot;number&quot;&gt;second_image_for_selling.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
